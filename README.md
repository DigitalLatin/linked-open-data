# DLL Catalog Linked Open Data
This repository holds the CSV export files pulled from the DLL Catalog's content management system, Python scripts for serializing that data in json-ld format, and the json-ld files.

The CSV files are in the directory "CSV". The json-ld files are in the directory "JSON". The Python scripts are in the directory "python".

The files in "CSV" and "JSON" will be updated every time new content is added to the DLL Catalog.
