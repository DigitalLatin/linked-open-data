# DLL Catalog Linked Open Data
This repository holds the CSV export files pulled from the DLL Catalog's content management system, Python scripts for serializing that data in json-ld format, and the json-ld files.

The CSV files are in the directory "csv". The json-ld files are in the directory "json-ld". The Python scripts are in the directory "python".

The files in "csv" and "json-ld" will be updated every time new content is added to the DLL Catalog.
